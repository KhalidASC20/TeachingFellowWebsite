                Actor Danny DeVito had his big break when he starred in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975). 
                He rose to fame on the sitcom Taxi (1978-1983), for which he won a Golden Globe Award and an Emmy. 
                He later produced and directed many films, including Matilda (1996), along with his wife of more than 30 years, actress Rhea Perlman. 
                DeVito has also enjoyed a starring role on the TV series It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia since 2006.

                Actor, director and producer Danny DeVito was born Daniel Michael DeVito Jr. on November 17, 1944, in Neptune, New Jersey.
                DeVito was raised by his mother, Julia, and his father, Danny Sr., a small business owner whose various ventures included a dry cleaner, luncheonette, dairy outlet and pool hall.
                DeVito attended Our Lady of Mount Carmel Grammar School and Oratory Prep High School in Summit, New Jersey, where he first tried his hand at acting, starring in school productions of St.
                Francis of Assisi and the Billion Dollar Saint.

            In 1971, DeVito landed the role of Martini in an off-Broadway production of Ken Kesey's classic novel, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.
            That role led to DeVito's big break four years later, when Douglas produced a film version of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and asked DeVito to revive his stage role.
            Widely praised by critics, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest swept the five major Academy Awards (Best Picture, Actor, Actress, Director and Screenplay) in 1976, catapulting DeVito into the national spotlight.
